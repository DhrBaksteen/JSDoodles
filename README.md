My JavaScript Doodles \o/

Expect all kinds of small JavaScripts here. This can be small graphics demos, useful functions, whatever...
Don't expect any optimized or well documented code...

What's in here??
----------------
**City**         - Paralax scrolling city skyline using tiles from Rampage for the Atari Lynx.

**JS Raycaster** - An attempt to writing a raycaster I did way back in 2008 not using the canvas.
